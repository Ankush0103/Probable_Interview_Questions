// Not solved


Today you decided to go to the gym. You currently have energy equal to E units. There are N exercises in the gym.
Each of these exercises drains Ai amount of energy from your body.

You feel tired if your energy reaches 0 or below. Calculate the minimum number of exercises you have to perform such that you become tired.
Every unique exercise can only be performed at most 2 times as others also have to use the machines.

If performing all the exercises does not make you feel tired, return -1.

Input Format
E :: INTEGER
The first line contains an integer, E, denoting the Energy.
E :: 1 -> 10^5

N :: INTEGER
The next line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of exercises. N :: 1 -> 10^5

A :: INTEGER ARRAY
Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < N) contains an integer describing the amount of energy drained by i-th exercise.
A[i] :: 1 -> 10^5
