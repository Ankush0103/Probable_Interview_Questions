/*
John was given a task to make a rectangular box during his innovation competition. He was given with
the A cm of wire and B cm2 of special paper. He had to use all the wire (for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box.
So what will be the maximum volume of that box?
Example 1:
Input:
A = 20, B = 14
Output:
3
Explanation:
The maximum volumed Rectangular
Box we can get is 3cm3.
Example 2:
Input:
A = 20, B = 16
Output:
4
Explanation:
The maximum volumed Rectangular
Box we can get is 4cm3.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getVol() which takes 2 Integers A, and B as input and
returns the answer.

// Don't run the program
//public class MaxVolRectangle {
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        static long getVol(int P, int A) {
//            float l = (float)(P - Math.sqrt(P * P - 24 * A)) / 12;
//            float V = (float)(l * (A / 2.0 - l * (P / 4.0 - l)));
//            return ( long )V;
//    }
//}
