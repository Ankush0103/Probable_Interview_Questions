Question 10 :A Good Prime Number
Problem Statement  :

A prime number is a number which is divisible by one and itself. Also a number is called a good  prime number if the sum of its
digits is a prime number. For example a number 23 is a good prime number because the sum of 2 and 3 ( 2+3=5) is 5 which is a prime number.
You are given an integer K. Your task is to find the kth good prime number that is greater than a provided number N.

For example , 232 is a good prime number since the sum of all digits is 7 which is a prime number whereas 235 is not a good prime number.
Input format :
The first line contains an integer N.
The next line contains an integer K.
Output format :
A single integer which is a Kth good prime number that is greater than a provided number N.
Constraints :
1<=N<=10^5
1<=K<<=10^5
Sample Input 1:
4  4
Sample Output 1:
12
Explanation :
Good prime numbers starting from 4 are 5,7,11(1+1=2 which is prime number),12(1+2=3 which is prime number),14(1+4=5 which is a prime number) and
so on. Because the sum of digits of an individual number is a prime number And 4 th good prime number is 12 in this series.
Hence the output is 12.
Sample Input 2:
17  5
Sample Output 2:
29
Explanation :
Good prime numbers starting from 17 are 20,21,23,25,29â€¦and the 5th prime number is 29.Hence the output is 29.
